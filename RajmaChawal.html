    <img width="400" height="350" src="images/RAJMACHAWAL.png" alt="error">


<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<P>
    This simple Indian dish consists of red beans (rajma) and cooked rice (chawal). Rajma is traditionally made with onions and tomato pur√©e which acts as a gravy for the red beans. This dish makes for a complete vegetarian meal that is suitable for lunch or dinner.</P>

<p>If desired, rajma chawal can be flavored with a variety of spices such as chili peppers, cinnamon, bay leaves, ginger, garlic, coriander, and cumin. Although the dish is quite simple to prepare, it takes some time because the beans are typically soaked overnight before the preparation.
