    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <p>These are fluffy deep fried Indian breads served with chole which are chickepeas cooked in a spicy masala. The
        refined flour dough for the bhature needs to be left to ferment for a few hours before being rolled into oval
        shaped discs and deep-fried. Chole-bhature is one of those few things that are worth the calories!</p>
